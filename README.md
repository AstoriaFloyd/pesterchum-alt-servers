# Pesterchum Alternate Servers
A mirror of pesterchum with added functionality to connect to alternative servers in response to the offical servers shutting down on 01-01-2021. (And with an edited setup.py file)

Normal pesterchum documentation is in "README-pesterchum.mkdn" and the one for Karxi's fork is README-karxi.mkdn.

## Servers
To connect to a server of your choosing, put the address in ```server.ini```.
