# Pesterchum Alternate Servers
Normal pesterchum documentation is in "README-pesterchum.mkdn", and the one for Karxi's fork is README-karxi.mkdn.

## Servers
Currently promts the user on launch to choose a server. The implementation of this very much done incorrectly, but it seems to function in it's current state.

## Building
Just simply running "python setup.py build" seems to be working for me for building on windows now.

Make sure you are running Python 2 and have all the dependencies installed. PyQt4 is no longer downloadable (at least, to my knowledge) via pip, but can still be installed from it's sourceforce page.
